    // and we want to make a copy of it.

    // You might think we can just do something like this:

    // however what happens when we update that array?

    // now here is the problem!

    // oh no - we have edited the original array too!

    // Why? It's because that is an array reference, not an array copy. They both point to the same array!

    // So, how do we fix this? We take a copy instead!

    // one way

    // or create a new array and concat the old one in

    // or use the new ES6 Spread

    // now when we update it, the original one isn't changed

    // The same thing goes for objects, let's say we have a person object

    // with Objects
    const person = {
      name: 'Wes Bos',
      age: 80
    };
    let person1 = Object.assign({}, person)

    }
    person2.ag0 = {value:2}

    console.log(person);
    console.log(person1);
    console.log(person2);
    console.clear(
    );
    // and think we make a copy:
    let person3 = Object.assign({city:"sf"},person1)
    console.log(person3);
    console.log(person1);
    let person4 = JSON.stringify(person)
    console.log(person4);
    console.log(JSON.parse(person4));
    // how do we take a copy instead?

    }

    let run2 = function running(){
      return "running"
    }

    let run3 = run

    // We will hopefully soon see the object ...spread

    // Things to note - this is only 1 level deep - both for Arrays and Objects. lodash has a cloneDeep method, but you should think twice before using it.
